        <h2>Using TanStack React Query</h2>
        <h5>Overview</h5>
        <p>TanStack React Query is a powerful tool for managing server state in your React applications. It simplifies data fetching, caching, synchronization, and updating, making your applications more performant and easier to maintain.</p>
        <h5>Key Benefits</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Caching:</em>Automatically caches query results to minimize redundant network requests.</li>
            <li><em>Synchronization:</em>Keeps your application state in sync with the server state.</li>
            <li><em>Stale-While-Revalidate:</em>Keeps stale data on the screen while fetching fresh data in the background.</li>
            <li><em>Background Fetching:</em>Fetches data in the background to keep the UI responsive.</li>
            <li><em>Error Handling:</em> Built-in mechanisms for error handling and retrying failed requests.</li>
        </ul>
